# Method Description 🛠️
Machine learning and deep learning models aims to learn a function $f(x; \theta)$ parameterized by weights and biases $\theta$ that minimizes a predefined loss function $L(y, F(x; \theta))$. 
The goal is to adjust parameters $\theta$ to create a function $f_{\theta} : X \rightarrow Y$ that accurately predicts labels $y$ for new data $x$. 
The parameters $\theta$ are optimized by minimizing the loss function over the training dataset:

$$
\theta^* = \arg\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{N} L(y_i, F(x_i; \theta))
$$

where $\theta^*$ represents the optimal parameters of the neural network. The gradient of the loss function is computed as:

$$
\nabla_{\theta} L(x, \hat{y}) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \nabla_{\theta} L(f(\theta, x_i), \hat{y}_i)
$$

where $f$ represents the neural network parameterized by $\theta$, and $\hat{y}_i$ denotes the predicted output for the $i$-th sample.


A deep learning model processes input through multiple layers to produce an output, compares it to the target, and uses backpropagation to compute gradients and optimize parameters.

**Intrusion Detection Optimization Problem**
In intrusion detection, this algorithm categorizes network flows as benign or malicious, using a machine learning model to map input $x$ to output $y$. 
Output $y$ corresponds to a class determined by $i$ in $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow {1, \ldots, k}$, where $k = 2$ for binary and $k \geq 3$ for multi-classification of attacks, 
maximizing $y = (f(x)_i + \epsilon_i)$ with model prediction $f(x)_i$ and uncertainty $\epsilon_i$.

The decision process categorizes network flows as :
**For Binary Classification**

$$
\text{Classify as malicious: } \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } P(M) > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\text{Classify as benign: } \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } P(M) \leq \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**For multi-classification:**

$$
\text{Classify as class } k: \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } P(k) = \max(P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(K)) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $P(k)$ represents the probability that a given observation belongs to class $k$, and $K$ represents the total number of classes.
